# Course Overview #

This training module provides a framework for a basic understanding of FME and for using FME in GIS and CAD integration.

The training will introduce basic concepts and terminology, help students become efficient users of FME, and direct them to resources to help apply the product to their own needs.

## Course Structure ##

The full course is made up of three main sections. These sections are:

- Lecture
- Lab Instruction
- Lab Exercises

The Lecture section is intended to be adapted by instructors to be taught in a classroom lecture. It covers conceptual issues of data integration and provides a high-level introduction to FME. Slides are provided [here](). The Lab Demonstration section provides a walkthrough of how to use FME and is designed to be taught by an instructor in a lab, with students optionally following along on their own computers. Finally, the Lab Exercises section provides hands-on activities for students to complete during lab time or as assignments. It contains questions and instructors may access the answers for use in grading [here]().

## Course Length ##

The instructor may choose to cover as many of these sections as they feel are required, or possible in the time permitted. They may also cover the course content in a different order and will skip or add new content to better customize the course to your needs.

Therefore the length and content of the course may vary.
