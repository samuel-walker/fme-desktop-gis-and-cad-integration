# Course Overview #

This training module provides a framework for a basic understanding of FME. We find users come to master one function, but go home with many new FME uses.

The training will introduce basic concepts and terminology, help students become efficient users of FME, and direct you to resources to help apply the product to your own needs.

## Course Structure ##

The full course is made up of three main sections. These sections are:

- Lecture
- Lab Instruction
- Lab Exercises

## Course Length ##

The instructor may choose to cover as many of these sections as they feel are required, or possible in the time permitted. They may also cover the course content in a different order and will skip or add new content to better customize the course to your needs.

Therefore the length and content of the course may vary.
