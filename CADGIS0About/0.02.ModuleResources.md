# Module Resources
A number of sample datasets and workspaces will be used in this module.

## On Your Training Computer
The data used in this training module is based on open data from the City of Vancouver, Canada.

Most exercises ask you to assume the role of a city planner at the fictional city of Interopolis and to solve a particular problem using this data.

Whether it's a local computer or a virtual computer hosted in the cloud, you'll find resources for the examples and exercises in the manual at the following locations:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Location</th>
    <th>Resource</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>C:\FMEData2016\Data</td>
  <td>Datasets used by the City of Interopolis</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>C:\FMEData2016\Resources</td>
    <td>Other resources used in the training</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>C:\FMEData2016\Workspaces</td>
    <td>Workspaces used in the student exercises</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>C:\FMEData2016\Output</td>
    <td>The location in which to write exercise output</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>< documents>\My FME Workspaces</td>
    <td>The default location to save FME workspaces</td>
  </tr>

</table>

You should also find FME pre-installed, plus a digital copy of this manual.
