# FME Desktop Training Module: GIS and CAD Integration

This is the manual for a training module for Safe Softwareâ€™s FME Desktop application. It covers the basics of using FME and GIS and CAD integration.

The training will introduce basic concepts and terminology, help students become efficient users of FME, and direct you to resources to help apply the product to your own needs.

## Module Structure

The module is made up of three main sections. These sections are:

* Lecture
* Lab Demonstration
* Lab Exercises

The Lecture section is intended to be adapted by instructors to be taught in a classroom lecture. It covers conceptual issues of data integration and provides a high-level introduction to FME. Slides are provided **here**. The Lab Demonstration section provides a walkthrough of how to use FME and is designed to be taught by an instructor in a lab, with students optionally following along on their own computers. Finally, the Lab Exercises section provides hands-on activities for students to complete during lab time or as assignments. It contains questions and instructors may access the answers for use in grading **here**.

All of this content is provided for instructors to use, adapt, and remix for their own courses. Please note that this use does come with some legal caveats, explained in the [Course Overview](/CADGIS0About/0.01.CourseOverview.md).
