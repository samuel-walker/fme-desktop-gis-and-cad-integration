# FME Desktop Training Module: GIS and CAD Integration

This is the manual for a training module for Safe Softwareâ€™s FME Desktop application. It provides a framework for a basic understanding of FME and for using FME in GIS and CAD integration.

The training will introduce basic concepts and terminology, help students become efficient users of FME, and direct them to resources to help apply the product to their own needs.

## Course Structure

The full course is made up of three main sections. These sections are:

- Lecture
- Lab Instruction
- Lab Exercises

The **Lecture** section is intended to be adapted by instructors to be taught in a classroom lecture. It covers conceptual issues of data integration and provides a high-level introduction to FME. Slides are provided [here]().

The **Lab Demonstration** section provides a walkthrough of how to use FME and is designed to be taught by an instructor in a lab, with students optionally following along on their own computers.

Finally, the **Lab Exercises** section provides hands-on activities for students to complete during lab time or as assignments. It contains questions; instructors may access the answers for use in grading [here]().

## Course Audience

This course is aimed at a second- to fourth-year university or college student audience. Students should have a passing familiarity with CAD and/or GIS technology. Prior knowledge of FME is not required. If the instructor wishes to adapt the course to a higher level the lecture and lab demonstration content can be shortened.

## Course Length

The instructor may choose to cover as many of these sections as they feel are required, or possible in the time permitted. They may also cover the course content in a different order and will skip or add new content to better customize the course to your needs. Therefore, the length and content of the course may vary.

All of this content is provided for instructors to use, adapt, and remix for their own courses. Please note that this use does come with some legal caveats, explained in [About this Document](/CADGIS0About/0.00.AboutThisDocument.md).
