# Lab Demonstration

In this section of the course, the instructor can walk students through the basic functionality of FME Workbench and FME Data Inspector. If your lab space permits it, students can follow along.

This content can also be adapted as lectures instead, if the instructor prefers.

# Learning Objectives

Students will learn:

1. **Quick translation** is the technique of carrying out a translation generated by FME, without further editing.
2. The **Generate Workspace** dialog is the main method by which a quick translation can be set up in FME Workbench.
3. Data inspection is a technique for checking and verifying data before, during, and after a translation. The **FME Data Inspector** is a tool for inspecting data.
4. A **schema** describes a datasetâ€™s structure, including its feature types, attributes, and geometries.
5. **Schema editing** is the act of editing the destination schema to better define what is required out of the translation.
6. The act of joining the source schema to the destination is called **schema mapping**. Differences between the two schemas lead to **structural transformation**.
7. **Content transformation** is the modifying of data content during a translation. In FME Workbench data transformation is carried out using objects called transformers.
