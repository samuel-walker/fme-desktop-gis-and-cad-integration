# FME Desktop #
This course is about FME Desktop. FME Desktop is for data translations and transformations at the desktop level (as opposed to FME Server, which is an enterprise-level, web-based product). 

FME Desktop consists of a number of different tools and applications. The two key applications are **FME Workbench** and the **FME Data Inspector**.

## FME Workbench ##
FME Workbench is the primary tool for defining data translations and data transformations. It has an intuitive point-and-click graphic interface to enable translations to be graphically described as a flow of data.

Workbench is not a standalone tool. It is fully integrated to interact with other FME Desktop applications such as the FME Data Inspector.


## FME Data Inspector ##
The FME Data Inspector is a tool for viewing data in any of the FME supported formats. It is used primarily for previewing data before translation or reviewing it after translation.

## FME Utilities ##
Besides Workbench and the Data Inspector, there are several other FME utilities.

- **FME Help**
	- A tool for browsing through the various help documents for FME.
- **FME Quick Translator**
	- A precursor to FME Workbench that is used only for quick translations requiring no data transformation.
- **FME Integration Console**
	- A tool for embedding FME functionality into other GIS and CAD applications such as ArcGIS, AutoCAD, Geomedia, and MapInfo.
- **FME Licensing Assistant**
	- An application for managing FME licensing.


## Other FME Desktop Components ##
Additional components are also included as part of FME Desktop (Professional Edition or higher).

- **FME Command Line Engine**
	- The FME Command Line Engine enables translations to be initiated at the command line level.
- **FME Plug-In SDK**
	- The FME Plug-In SDK allows developers to add formats and functionality to the FME core.
