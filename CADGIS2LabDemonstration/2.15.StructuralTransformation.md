# Structural Transformation #
Transforming a dataset's structure requires using FME to manipulate *schemas*. FME uses the term "schema", but you may know this as *data model*.

## Schema Concepts ##
A ***schema*** defines the structure of a dataset. Each dataset has its own unique schema; it includes layers, attributes, and other rules that define or restrict its content.

### Schema Representation ###
When a new workspace is created, FME scans the source datasets. It creates a ***reader*** whose layers are illustrated on the left side of the workspace canvas, and a ***writer*** whose layers are illustrated on the right side of the workspace canvas:

Each object in this illustration represents a subdivision in the source dataset. In FME terminology these objects are called <strong>feature types</strong>. Multiple feature types means there are multiple layers in the source dataset.

### Reader Schema ###
For the reader, more information about the schema is revealed by clicking the cog-wheel icon on each feature type object:

This Feature Type dialog has a number of tabs. Under the Parameters tab is a set of general parameters, such as the name of the feature type (in this case Libraries) the allowed geometry types, and the name of the parent dataset:

The User Attributes tab shows a list of attributes. Each attribute is defined by its name, data type, width, and number of decimal places:

Each layer has a different name and can also have a completely different set of attributes. All of this information goes to make up the reader schema. It is literally ***"what we have"***.


### Writer Schema ###
As with the reader, each writer has a set of detailed schema information accessed by opening the dialog for a feature type:

By default, the writer schema (***"what we want"***) is a mirror image of the source, so the output from the translation will be a duplicate of the input. This allows users to translate from format to format without further edits (*Quick Translation*).

If *"what we want"* is different to the default schema definition, we simply have to change it using a technique called ***Schema Editing***.

FME supports 400+ formats and there are almost as many terms for the way data is subdivided. The most common terms are layer, table, class, category, level, or object.
<br><br>Although the general FME term for these subdivisions is <strong>feature type</strong>, all dialogs in FME Workbench use format-specific terminology where the correct term is applicable.
