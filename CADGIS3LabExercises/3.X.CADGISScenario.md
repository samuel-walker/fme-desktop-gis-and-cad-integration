# CAD GIS Data Integration Scenario-based Exercise

Ex text

We have several goals for the exercise:

- Identify water network pipes that are older than 1935 to schedule them for replacement
- Create CAD site drawings of each property parcel that will be affected by this replacement
- Create an Excel file for the department who will conduct mass-mailings to alert affected property owners

We will start with our data in the common GIS format Esri shapefile format and translate it to AutoDesk .dwg and Excel .xlsx formats. Along the way we will use several transformers to alter the structure and content of our data.

# Steps

1. Add combined SHP reader for water transmission and distribution networks
2. Add separate ACAD writers, both with Attribute Output set to Extended Entity Data
3. Check output in DI to see attributes preserved as extended entity data
4. Add TestFilter
5. Add SHP reader for property parcel polygons (combine with water?)
5. Add Intersector of TestFilter and parcels
6. Add result to site ACAD writer; also add transmission mains for reference
7. Add MapTextLabeller to label site drawings
8. Add Excel writer feature type
9. Sorter? AttributeManager for
Connect Intersector output to Excel writer feature type
