Article created with FME Desktop 2018.0

Introduction
============

This article will show you how to convert an AutoCAD DWG (\*.dwg) file
to MicroStation DGN (\*.dgn) format. The AutoCAD roads data is divided
into different layers for each road type, each of which has a different
symbology. We\'ll use FME to convert this roads data to MicroStation,
alter some of the symbology, write DWG attributes to Microstation tags,
and merge a few of these layers together.

***Note:** this video was created with FME version 2016.0. Some of the
steps might be slightly different, but the overall process is the same.
The instructions below are for 2018.0.*

Source Data
===========

The data used in this article originates from open data made available
by the [City of Vancouver](http://data.vancouver.ca/) , British
Columbia. It contains information licensed under the Open Government
License - Vancouver.

Step-by-Step Instructions
=========================

To create the demo, you will need to carry out the following steps.

**1) Start FME Workbench**

In Windows this is found under Start \> All Programs \> FME Desktop \>
FME Workbench

**2) Select Generate Workspace**

This is found on the Create Workspace section of the FME Workbench
interface. Alternatively, use Ctrl+G as a shortcut.

**3) Browse to and select the source (reader) dataset**

Browse for and select the source AutoCAD data (Roads.dwg). The file
extension for Roads.dwg tells FME what format of data we are working
with (Autodesk AutoCAD DWG/DXF).

**4) Set the output (writer) format to Bentley Microstation Design (V8)
DGN**

Select Bentley Microstation Design (V8) DGN for the format for the
writer; do this by typing the name into the field until it appears
within the dropdown list.

**5) Set the output dataset location**

Set your output location to whatever best suits your directory
structure. If you are using the template file above, it will write your
output to a Roads folder in your template folder (on Windows,
C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\, with template data stored
in folders beginning with wb\_template).

**6) Modify the input parameters**

Click the Parameters button for the reader. The Autodesk AutoCAD DWG/DXF
Parameters dialog box opens.

-   Select Group Entities By 'Attribute Schema'. This means we can
    visualize the layers of data with attribute information.

Notice how there are also parameters on this dialog box to control other
aspects of reading DWG data.

**7) Modify the writer parameters**

Click the Parameters button for the writer. The Bentley MicroStation
(V8) Parameters dialog box opens.

-   First, we will change the seed file from being 3D to 2D. Using the
    box next to Seed File (V8 only), navigate to the new seed file
    (seed2d\_ft\_v8.dgn). You can download it above or find it in your
    FME installation folder under .\\FME
    2018\\design\\seed2d\_ft\_v8.dgn.
-   Next, we will tell FME to write tags for the features. Use the
    drop-down list from Write Tags and select 'yes'. Click OK to dismiss
    the Bentley MicroStation (V8) Parameters dialog box. Click OK to
    create the workspace and OK again to include all feature types from
    the reader.

**8) Modify feature schema ("Schema Mapping")**

If we\'re happy with an exact copy of the source data we could just run
this translation now, but we want to make some changes first.

-   First, merge the 'private', 'noncity' and 'other' layers into a
    single layer called 'other'; we can do that easily by dragging the
    connections onto the 'other' input port. We call this schema
    mapping.
-   We no longer need the 'noncity' and 'private' writer feature types,
    so delete them.

**9) Add the DGNStyler transformer**

In addition, we can modify the output symbology by using a transformer
in FME called the DGNStyler. Add a DGNStyler before the Other writer
feature type by selecting its input port and typing DGNStyler to bring
up the transformer in the Quick Add menu. Double-click it or press enter
to add it to the canvas, which should now look like this:

*DGNStyler on the canvas*

Click the DGNStyler to open it in the Parameter Editor window. Let's add
some parameters to style the Other writer feature type:

-   Expand and click the 'Color' checkbox. Set a lilac color for the
    output features under 'RGB Color' (e.g. 0.666667,0.666667,1).
-   Expand and click the 'Lines' checkbox.
    -   Set the 'Line Weight' to 3.
    -   Set the 'Line Style' to 2.

Your DGNStyler Parameter Editor window should now look like this:

*DGNStyler parameters*

**10) Click the Run button on the toolbar**

Run the workspace by clicking on the green play button. This carries out
the translation.

**11) View the DGN file in a MicroStation Viewer**

Once complete, use a file browser to locate the output dataset. If we
use a 3rd party CAD viewer such as [Bentley
View](https://www.bentley.com/en/products/product-line/modeling-and-visualization-software/bentley-view)
to inspect the data, we will see that the line data in the DGN file has
been written using the symbology specified in the DGNStyler, and DWG
attributes have been written into Microstation tags. Here you can see
the Burrard Bridge in Vancouver has been styled under the Other writer
feature type (dashed line) and has its attributes as tags.
